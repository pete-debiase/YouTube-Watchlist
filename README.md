# YouTube
Sometimes I watch YouTube videos on various software engineering topics to reinforce concepts encountered in other contexts and/or to pick up a new trick here and there.

Notes taken here are likely to be very sparse - this is intended to be a relatively low-key extracurricular study activity to kill time on the elliptical. In the spirit of the Dokugaku project, I mostly just want to keep a record of which videos I have watched so far.
