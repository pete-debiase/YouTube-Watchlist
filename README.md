# YouTube
Sometimes I watch YouTube videos on various software engineering topics to reinforce concepts encountered in other contexts and/or to pick up a new trick here and there.

Notes taken here are likely to be very sparse - this is intended to be a relatively low-key extracurricular study activity to kill time on the elliptical. In the spirit of the Dokugaku project, I mostly just want to keep a record of which videos I have watched so far.

### Abdul Bari Algorithms
An apparently very well-regarded YouTube playlist on algorithms ([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)).
